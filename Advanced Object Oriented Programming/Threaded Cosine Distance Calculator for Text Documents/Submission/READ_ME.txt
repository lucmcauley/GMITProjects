Rail Cipher project - Luc McAuley

For this Rail cipher project, I have added a few features.

- Error handling for every issue I could foresee, including verifying a URL with code 200 and verifying that a file location is either taken or available (See the Verification class).
- Ability to save and load previous save states (SerialisationMenu Class).
- User generated in-command line text - only one line available but would have liked to be able to do multiple starting at selectTypedText selecting choice 3 in the InputMenu Class.
- Display all of the information legibly from the Rail Cipher - See option 6 in the main menu when running the application.
