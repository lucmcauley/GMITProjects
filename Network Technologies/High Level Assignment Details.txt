Network Technologies - Final Assignment

Chat Application Functionality:
• Server starts up and waits for socket connections on a specific port.
• Client starts up and attempts to create a socket connection to the server.
• If a connection is successfully formed, then the client and server should be able
to facilitate a text-based chat session between users at the client and server side, i.e.
o Client and server should allow the user to enter text at the console (command line).
o Messages entered by the user should be sent across the socket connection to the other application and displayed at the console.
• Users should be able to gracefully end the chat session and close the connection by entering “\q”.
